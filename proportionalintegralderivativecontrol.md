## Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control

This code implements a simulation of a robot's motion control using proportional control. The initial state of the robot, defined as x0, is [0; 0; 0], representing the initial position and orientation of the robot. The time span for the simulation, defined as tspan, is [0, 20] seconds.

The control gains for the motion control are defined as kp_x, kp_y, and kp_theta, representing the proportional gains in the x-direction, y-direction, and orientation, respectively. The code loops through all possible combinations of these control gains to simulate the robot's motion under different control scenarios.

The control law function, controllaw, computes the derivative of the state based on the current time, state, and control gains. It also computes the error between the current state and the desired state, which is defined as a sinusoidal path in the x-y plane.

The robot's motion is plotted using the plot_robot_motion function, which plots the trajectory of the robot in the x-y plane. The performance of the control parameters is analyzed using the analyze_performance function, which computes the mean squared error between the actual and desired position of the robot.

Overall, the code provides a simulation and analysis of the robot's motion control using proportional control, and can be used as a starting point for further refinement and optimization of the control parameters.
